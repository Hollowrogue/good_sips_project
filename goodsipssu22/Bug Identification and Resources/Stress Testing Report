Tested:
- All navigating icons/buttons works fine
- BarTab can add over hundred drinks to the list 
- MySips adds only reviewed drinks 
- MasterList is consistent

Errors:
- BarTabList.swift
- DrinkListViewModel.swift
- Webservice.swift

Bugs:
- "Add new" button on BarTab adds an empty string to the list
- "Search" button on "Search Cocktails" displays all the drinks with the letter "A" when typed "A" instead of displaying drinks starting with an "A"
- BarTab adds a same drink twice. The user can only add the drink once and review it once
- The information is not saved after refreshing the page

TO-DO:
