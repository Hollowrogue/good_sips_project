Basics of swift:


* Declare constants by let keyword
* Declare variables by var keyword
* No main() method to serve as the program’s starting point when the operating system loads the application
* No semicolon required at the end of statements
* Type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use
* The print(_:separator:terminator:) function prints one or more values to an appropriate output
* UInt is the same size as the x-bit machine
* Set nil to a valueless variable
* For-in loop makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, etc
* Functions: prefixed with the func keyword. Indicate the function’s return type with the return arrow -> (a hyphen followed by a right angle bracket), which is followed by the name of the type to return.
* Place the function return type at the right-hand side of the function declaration, rather than the left
* Declare structures with struct keyword
* Declare classes with class keyword
* Use dot syntax to access properties of an instance
* An instance method has implicit access to all other instance methods and properties of that type
* errors are represented by values of types that conform to the Error protocol
* Use defer statement even when no error handling is required
* Uses camelCase for naming conventions
* Can use Cocoa framework
